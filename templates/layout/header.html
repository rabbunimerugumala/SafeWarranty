<!--
Notes:
1. The `navbar-expand-lg` class ensures the navbar adjusts for different screen sizes.
2. The `bg-dark` and `text-light` classes apply the dark theme with light text.
3. The `text-warning` class adds the golden yellow accent for the icon.
4. The `fs-2` class controls font size, and `d-flex align-items-center` centers items vertically.
5. Added spacing with `ms-2` for a cleaner look.
